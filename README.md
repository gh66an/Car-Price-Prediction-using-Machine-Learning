# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts the prices of cars based on various features using **Machine Learning** algorithms. The primary models used include **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, and **Lasso Regression** to ensure robust predictions and minimize overfitting.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for training.
- **Modeling**: Implemented different regression models (Linear, Ridge, and Lasso) to predict car prices.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the models based on their accuracy and performance metrics.
- **Visualization**: Visualized the relationship between predicted and actual car prices.

## Algorithms Used
1. **Linear Regression**: A basic algorithm used to model the relationship between the car features and prices.
2. **Ridge Regression**: An enhanced regression model with regularization to avoid overfitting and handle multicollinearity.
3. **Lasso Regression**: Another regularization technique that helps in feature selection by shrinking less important feature coefficients to zero.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb
```
Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.

## Results
The project outputs the accuracy of the Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models, and visualizes the comparison between predicted and actual car prices.
